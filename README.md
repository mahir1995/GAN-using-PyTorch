This is an implementation of GAN (Generative Adversial Networks) from scratch using PyTorch

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms developed in recent times. 

Generative Adversarial Networks are composed of two models:

The first model is called a Generator and it aims to generate new data similar to the expected one. The Generator could be asimilated to a human art forger, which creates fake works of art.
The second model is named the Discriminator. This model’s goal is to recognize if an input data is ‘real’ — belongs to the original dataset — or if it is ‘fake’ — generated by a forger. In this scenario, a Discriminator is analogous to the police (or an art expert), which tries to detect artworks as truthful or fraud.

The jupyter notebook contains an implementation of GAN from scratch using PyTorch. It contains 2 neural networks. A Generator Network and Discriminator Network, that compete and cooperate with each other. In the course of training, both networks eventually learn how to perform their tasks.

Here are my results after 200 epochs
